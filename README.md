# NGen

**NGen** is a web app that can generate a wide variety of unique fantasy names. It has a been used a lot for roleplaying purposes, the names are unique, but they are based on existing ones based on the race. I took my name sample from [this](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Names) website.

## How does it work?
NGen is an integration of a python script I made separately. I used [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) to create the web app. It deals with the template renders and request.


It is hosted [here](https://jayp.pythonanywhere.com/).
